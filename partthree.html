<title> Marketing/hype era </title>

<img src="21665536.jpg">

<h2> From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. Baseball became more known and recognized because of this.</h2>
