<h2 class="color">Why is there <span class="italicize">Copyright?</span></h2>

<p class="color"> Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work the right to say how other people can use it. And can also protect their work from people stealing it. For students, they break the laws all the time. It may seem easier to copy someones work but there could be copyright to that source. It is very important to be educated on this. </p>
